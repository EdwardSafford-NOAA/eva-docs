# Eva user guide

This section provides information tailored to users of eva. The following sections do not attempt to explain the inner workings of eva but rather explain how to use the data ingest, transform and plotting classes.

As noted in the introductory material, eva has two basic running modes: batch processing and interactive processing. For each class within eva the general API for accessing the class using these two techniques are outlined.
