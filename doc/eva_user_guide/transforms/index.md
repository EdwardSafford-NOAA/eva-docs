# Eva transform classes

This section descibes the various classes that eva provides for creating new variables from the variables read in the ingest classes.

New variables may be created by filtering existing variables `accept_where`, applying arithmetic manipulations to existing variables `arithmetic`,
generating statistics from a specific data dimension `channel_stats`, or selecting or slicing the data by time `select_time`.
