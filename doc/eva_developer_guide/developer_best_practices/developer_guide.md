## Eva GitHub Tips and Tricks
The eva repository sits under the JCSDA-internal organization on GitHub. While the repository is publicly readable and anyone can clone the repository, write access is limited to members of the JCSDA-internal organizaation. These members are typically employees and affiliates of the JCSDA and its core partner agencies. Any developer, however, is welcome to fork the repository and issue pull requests for consideration for inclusion in the authoratative repository by the eva maintainers.
